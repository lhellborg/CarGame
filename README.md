#Car Game
This is a game made to play without internetconnection for example when travelling.
##How to play
You can play it in many different ways:
-Check the pictures and see if you can spot them outside the window. Press the card and get points. Most points win when travel is over or when time is out.
-Make all pictures the same by pressing the cards. Least scores win.
-Make all pictures the same but the score should be as close to 10 as possible (or any other number). 
-Make up your own game and challenge the family.
